# Econ-dashboard-backend

This repository contains the code for the following:
1. The flask backend used to send data to the front-end requests.
2. The upload scripts and delete scripts to upload and process data.

## Upload Script

To use the upload script, we first need to setup the project (this is a one time setup).

TODO: add instructions here

We then need to download the file (this needs to be done each month)

First we need to download the data file fom safegraph.
To do so, first select the city as San Jose, CA, US on the safegraph shop.
